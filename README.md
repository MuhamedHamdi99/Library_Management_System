The Library Management System provides functionalities to manage books, patrons, and borrowing records efficiently. It includes RESTful API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on books and patrons, as well as actions related to borrowing and returning books. The system ensures data integrity, input validation, error handling, and security features for authentication and authorization.

##Key Components:
#Entities:
-Book: Represents a book in the library with attributes like ID, title, author, publication year, and ISBN.
-Patron: Represents a library patron with attributes like ID, name, and contact information.
-Borrowing Record: Tracks the association between books and patrons, including borrowing and return dates.

#API Endpoints:
Provides RESTful endpoints for managing books, patrons, and borrowing records.
Supports operations such as adding, updating, deleting books and patrons, borrowing books, and returning books.

#Data Storage:
Utilizes a relational database ( MySQL) to persist book, patron, and borrowing record details.
Establishes proper relationships between entities, such as one-to-many between books and borrowing records.

#Validation and Error Handling:
Implements input validation for API requests to ensure data integrity.
Handles exceptions gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

#Security:
Supports basic authentication to protect API endpoints from unauthorized access.

#Transaction Management:
Implements declarative transaction management using Spring's @Transactional annotation to ensure data integrity during critical operations.

#Testing:
Includes unit tests to validate the functionality of API endpoints.
Utilizes testing frameworks like JUnit, Mockito, or SpringBootTest for testing.

#Project Structure:
The project follows a modular structure with packages for controllers, services, repositories, models, and configurations. Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the system, promoting code organization and maintainability.

#Evaluation Criteria:
The project is evaluated based on functionality, code quality, error handling, testing coverage, and additional features like security, transaction management, caching, and logging. These aspects ensure the system's reliability, performance, and scalability in a real-world library environment.


## HOW TO USE SYSTEM:

1. Clone the Repository:
Clone the project repository from your version control system (e.g., GitHub) to your local machine.

2. Set Up the Database:
Ensure you have a relational database system installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Create a new database schema for the Library Management System.

3. Configure the Database Connection:
Open the application.properties file (or application.yml if YAML configuration is used).
Configure the database connection properties such as URL, username, password, and dialect.

4. Build the Project:
Navigate to the project directory using a terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to build the project: "mvn clean install"

5. Run the Application:
After a successful build, you can run the application using Maven or your IDE.
If using Maven, run the following command:"mvn spring-boot:run"

6. Access the Application:
Once the application is running, you can access the RESTful API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
Use the provided API documentation to understand the available endpoints and their usage.
Test the endpoints for CRUD operations on books, patrons, and borrowing records.

7. Testing:
Run the provided unit tests to validate the functionality of API endpoints and ensure proper coverage.
Use testing frameworks like JUnit, Mockito, or SpringBootTest for testing.

8. Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any issues during setup or execution, refer to the error messages for troubleshooting.
Check the application logs for any exceptions or errors that may occur during runtime.
